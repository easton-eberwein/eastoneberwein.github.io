This blog is mostly just a tester. I threw in a banner picture and a thumbnail. 

This Project was a frustrating learning experience, but I think I accomplished a good amount for how much went wrong. Crazy to think that the semester is almost over! I have learned a lot and hope that I can apply this useful information to the real world industry one day!
